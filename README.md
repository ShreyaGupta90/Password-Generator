# Python Password Generator 🔑

A simple yet effective password generator built using Python’s **`string`** and **`random`** modules. This tool creates secure, randomly generated passwords by combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access.

## Features ✨
- Generates strong, unpredictable passwords.
- Includes a mix of:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Digits (0-9)
  - Special characters (!, @, #, etc.)
- User-friendly and lightweight.
- Built with minimal yet efficient Python code.

## How It Works 🛠️
The program uses **`random.choice()`** to randomly select characters from a combination of all allowed characters. This randomness ensures complexity, making it harder for attackers to guess or brute-force passwords.

## Requirements 📋
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
